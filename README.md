## LCD Backpack
This assignment, I learned how to use a LCD backpack. I used an LCD screen, a LCD backpack, a button, and an Arduino. When the button was pressed, the counter shown by the LCD screen would go up by 1. LCD backpacks reduced the amount of digital pins needed. This is very helpfull if there are many components of your circuit that need to wired and you need digital pins.

### Reflection 
If there's a problem and you're not sure what it is, it's a good idea to check your wiring.


## Hello LCD
This assignment I learned how to use and LCD screen. I used an LCD screen and an Arduino. The goal was to get the LCD screen to print "Hello". The hardest part about this assignment was the wiring. I used wires in the beginning, instead of an LCD screen with male ends. Cutting all the wires was a waste of time and ended up being useless.

### Reflection 
Be very careful with the wiring, because that can make a simple assignment difficult.

## LED Blink Revisited
This assignment was how to blink an LED using an Arduino, and also made us to use analog pins instead of digital pins to get the LED to fade. Not only did we have to make the LED fade, but the serial monitor had to display a certain number of xs, which was based on the brightness of the LED.
